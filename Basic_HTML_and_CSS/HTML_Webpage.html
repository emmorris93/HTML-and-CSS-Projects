			<h4>First Verse</h4>
			<p><span style="font-style:italic;">
			I know you're clinging to the light of day<br>
			To tell you everything's a-okay<br>
			And medication don't do much<br>
			Yeah, it just numbs the brain<br>
			Guess you might say I'm a little intense<br>
			I'm on the bright side of being hell-bent<br>
			So, take it from me, you're not the only one<br>
			Who can't see straight (can't see straight)<br>

			<h4>Lead-Up to Chorus</h4>
			<p><span style="font-style:normal;">
				If you were ever in doubt<br>
				Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof<br>
				Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed<br>
				But you gotta try<br>
				And I'm calling out<br>
			</span></p>

			<h4>Chorus</h4>
			<p><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">
				Get up, get up<br>
				Get a move on<br>
				Get up, get up<br>
				What's taking so long?<br>
				Get up, get up<br>
				Get a move on<br>
				Stop stalling, I'm calling out<br>
				Get up, get up<br>
				Get a move on<br>
				Get up, get up<br>
				Ain't nothing wrong<br>
				'Cause I believe you can be whatever<br>
				And I agree you can do much better, trust me<br>
			</span></p>

			<h4>Second Verse</h4>
			<p><span style="font-style:italic;">
				Everybody wants to sing their song<br>
				So, Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?"<br>
				Ain't nothing normal when it comes to you and me<br>
				I'd rather twist myself in knots than watch you give up on your dreams<br>

			<h4>Spoken</h4>
			<p><span style="font-style: normal;">
				Yeah, I don't know why I never talk about it<br>
				I guess that's probably part of the problem<br>
				Yeah, sometimes you're wrong, sometimes you're right<br>
				Just gotta keep moving<br>
				Yeah, I'm just gonna keep moving<br>
				Today, tomorrow, gonna get<br>
