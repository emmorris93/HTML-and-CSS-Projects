        <h1>World of Warcraft Druid Class</h1>

        <p>
            Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. 
            With experience, druids can unleash nature's raw energy against their enemies, 
            raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, 
            or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones.<br>

            Druidsâ€™ changing forms let them assume different roles and focus on either tanking, healing, or damage. They can also shapeshift to travel faster on land, sea, and air.<br>

            When shapeshifted into their bear form, druids possess a thick skin and imposing presence that makes them ideal front-line protectors of weaker party members.<br>
            By calling upon the powers of nature, druids are able to swiftly restore health to their injured allies.<br>
            Druids can take on the form of a savage cat in order to claw and bite their enemies up close, or that of a wild moonkin to blast enemies from afar.<br>
