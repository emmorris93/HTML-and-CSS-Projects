<!-- FINAL ASSIGNMENT
    1. Open index.html in an IDE and find a line of code that you aren’t quite sure what it does exactly. Then perform the following actions:
        a. Delete that line of code (note down what you deleted because you will be re-implementing it in a later step).
        b. Save the file.
        c. Run it in the browser.
        d. Notice what changes (if any) occurred with the webpage.
        e. Revert the file back to the original (undo the deleted line of code) and save it again so the website is in working order again.
    2. Perform the same actions with portfolio.css. I.e.:
        a. Open portfolio.css in an IDE.
        b. Find a line of code that you aren’t quite sure what it does.
        c. Delete that line of code (note down what you deleted because you will be re-implementing it in a later step).
        d. Save the file.
        e. Run it in the browser.
        f. Notice what changes (if any) occurred with the webpage.
        g. Revert the file back to the original (undo the deleted line of code) and save it again so the website is in working order again.
    NOTE: If for some reason you cannot revert your changes, delete the Student_Portfolio folder and re-download it here:
        HTML and CSS Portfolio Code 
For your personal portfolio site you will need to provide your own images. You may need to crop your images to ensure proper dimensions.
To do this on a Windows PC, you can edit the photo in the “Photos” app and use the crop tool.
Here are some websites where you can get free stock photos and videos to use in your portfolio site:
    1. Pexels
    2. Pixabay
    3. Stocksnap.io 
Using the provided templates (http://htmlandcssportfolio.com/, index.html and portfolio.css) as a guide, create your portfolio site.
We highly recommend typing all of this code from scratch yourself instead of copying and pasting. This will give you a better idea of what each line of code does exactly, and provide you with more experience.
It is recommended that you keep the basic layout provided.
You are allowed to keep some of the styling (background colors, fonts, etc.) for your site but are required to customize (personalize) at least one element of the site. Here are some example customizations:
    Font,
    Colors,
    Video,
    Hover effects, etc.
Ensure that the content (i.e. text contained within the Home, About and GitHub sections) is customized and reflects what you want to say about yourself.
It is highly recommended that you save and run your code often. Factually, you should test your code after adding each element and each CSS class/ID. That way you can instantly spot issues in your code and so more easily isolate the source of problems.

DEBUGGING TIPS:
    Save and run your code every time you add a new line.
    Research online for solutions – using:
        https://www.google.com/,
        https://www.w3schools.com/ and
        https://stackoverflow.com/
as resources.
    Write your code within Visual Studio Code so that you can utilize LiveShare to get Instructor assistance as needed – as a reminder, LiveShare allows them to access your code remotely.
Once complete, save all files and folders and successfully run your code in the browser. -->
